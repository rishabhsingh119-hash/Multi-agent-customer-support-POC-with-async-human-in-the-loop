"""Concept: read-only data access for mocked tools.

The mocked tools (tools/mock_tools.py) are the only callers of
`get_read_only_connection()`. That connection is opened via SQLite's URI
`mode=ro`, which makes write-safety a real, DB-enforced guarantee rather
than a coding convention: any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE attempted through it
raises `sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database`.

SQLite has no user/role system, so unlike Postgres there's no per-table
GRANT to lean on — a read-only *connection* is the strongest access
control an embedded, single-file database can offer, and it's enough for
this POC. See README for the full explanation.

The read-write connection (`get_admin_connection`) is used exclusively by
db/init_db.py to build/seed the database — nothing at runtime (tools,
agents, graphs) ever imports it.
