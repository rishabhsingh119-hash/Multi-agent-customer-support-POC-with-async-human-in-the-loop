"""Concept: Context Compaction (Section 3.3 of the spec) — arguably the
main teaching point of this whole project.

By the time this node runs, the conversation might be 10+ messages long.
Every downstream step (routing, the specialist agents, the tools they call)
only ever needs a handful of facts out of that — not the raw transcript.
This node is the one and only place that reads the full history and
distills it into `CompactedTicketInfo`. From here on, the rest of the graph
passes that small JSON object around instead of re-sending the whole
conversation to every LLM call.

Why this matters in practice: every additional turn makes the raw history
larger and more expensive to re-parse, and burying the actually-relevant
fields inside a wall of chat text makes routing logic and tool calls more
error prone. Compact once, reuse everywhere.
