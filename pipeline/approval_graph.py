"""Concept: Asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop, resolution side (Section 5).

This is a second, completely independent LangGraph — it shares no live
execution with the customer-turn graph in pipeline/graph.py. The only thing
connecting the two is shared storage (session/session_store.py): this graph
reads a session's history, appends an outcome message to it, and writes it
back. The next time that session's chat is opened, the message is just...
there, like an async notification arrived while the customer was away.

Kept as a tiny graph (rather than a plain if/else function) deliberately,
so a student can see the same StateGraph/conditional-edge primitives reused
for a second, unrelated flow.
