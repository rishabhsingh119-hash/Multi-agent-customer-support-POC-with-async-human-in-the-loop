"""Concept: Tool Usage (Section 3.4 of the spec).

Every function here does a real data lookup against the embedded SQLite
database (db/) — not a hardcoded fabrication. Each opens a read-only
connection (db.connection.get_read_only_connection): the connection itself
is opened via SQLite's `mode=ro` URI, so any attempted write through it
fails at the SQLite level, not just by convention. See db/connection.py
and the README for the full explanation of what "read-only" does and
doesn't guarantee on an embedded, single-file database.

There is no `issue_refund` tool. No refund is ever issued by an agent —
every eligible refund request goes to manual review (see
agents/refunds_agent.py and pipeline/approval_graph.py).
