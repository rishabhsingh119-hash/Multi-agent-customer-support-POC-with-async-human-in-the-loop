"""Thin wrapper around LiteLLM — the *only* place in the codebase that calls
`litellm.completion(...)`.

Concept: every model call in this POC (both the Info-Gathering node and the
Context Compaction node) goes through `complete_json`, and the model name
comes from config.py, not a string literal buried in a node. If you ever
swap providers (OpenAI -> Anthropic -> a local model via Ollama), this is
the one function whose behavior you're relying on, and config.py is the one
line you'd change.

No retries, no fallback models, no streaming — this is a POC, and adding
that machinery here would obscure the teaching point rather than help it.
