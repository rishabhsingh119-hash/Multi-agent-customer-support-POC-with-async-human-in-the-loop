"""Refunds Agent — a graph node reached once routing assigns
`assigned_team = "refunds_team"` (see pipeline/graph.py).

Policy: no refund of any amount is ever issued by this agent. Every
eligible refund request is filed as a `PendingApproval` and goes to manual
review — there is no threshold-based "small refunds auto-issue" branch.
This node's only job for an eligible request is to file it and hand back a
reply; it never learns how the request is eventually resolved. That
happens later, in a completely separate graph invocation kicked off from
the Approver View (see pipeline/approval_graph.py) — nothing here waits or
blocks on that outcome.
