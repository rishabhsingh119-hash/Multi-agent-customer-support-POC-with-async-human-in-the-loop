"""Billing Agent — a graph node reached once routing assigns
`assigned_team = "payments_team"` (see pipeline/graph.py).

No LLM call here on purpose: by this point `compacted_info` already has
everything needed, and the "agent" is really just deterministic tool
orchestration + a templated reply. The diagram in the spec only marks the
Info-Gathering and Compaction nodes as LLM calls — specialist agents just
act on the structured facts they're handed.
